# Comparison of Transformer, CNN, and CNN-RNN Mixed Model for Geo-Classification
In this paper, we compare three models for a geo-classification task. The modelâ€™s
goal is to determine which country an image is taken from. Three architectures will
be investigated: CNN + MLP, CNN + RNN + MLP, and ViT + MLP. The results showed that the vision transformer had the best results, while the pretrained CNN + RNN model was second, and the CNN model needed more training to achieve similar accuracies.
